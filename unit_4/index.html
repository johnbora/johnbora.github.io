<h1>Letters from the Old Dominion</h1>
	
	<p>A blog about exploring the Commonwealth, county by county, landmark by forgotten landmark.</p>
	<img alt="Picture of Myself" src="images/Xhoni24.jpg"> 
	<p>In this blog I will recount the travels I have completed in Virginia. From old plantations with hidden family histories to historical sites that go further back to the founding of the U.S. Virginia keeps many secrets. My mission is to explore all of it, visiting all the counties and the historical sites within. There is music, nature, and a quiet solitute only found in the further reaches of Virginia. This is a list of visited counties. More to come...</p>
