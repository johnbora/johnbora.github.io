	<p>A blog about exploring the Commonwealth, county by county, landmark by forgotten landmark.</p>

<p>In this blog I will recount the travels I have completed in Virginia. From old plantations with hidden family histories to historical sites that go further back to the founding of the U.S., Virginia holds many secrets. My mission thus is to explore all of it, visiting all the counties and the historical sites within. But it is not only history that interests me. </p>

<p>There is music, nature, and a quiet solitute only found in the further reaches of Virginia. This is a list of visited counties. More to come...</p>
